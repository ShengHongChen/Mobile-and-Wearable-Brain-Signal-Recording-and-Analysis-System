# Abstract
Based on the convenience and speed of mobile devices, users wear a physiological recording device before sleep to measure forehead EEG, including EEG and EOG. Using Bluetooth, the connection is established within seconds, allowing **real-time measurement of brainwaves, packet dissection, data conversion, and spectrum analysis on the phone**. The results are presented graphically on the screen, enabling users to clearly understand the signal conditions.
